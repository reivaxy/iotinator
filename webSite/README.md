# The iotinator.com website.

It hosts most of js and css files used by the iotinator webapp, since only a "loader page" is downloaded from the iotinator master module local server.

It also hosts pages presenting the project, as well as a mySql database to store logs and statistics for iotinator swarms.

The my.iotinator.com sub domain is used to automatically connect to a iotinator master module connected to the same network as your terminal without having to know its ip.
