#Iotinator web application

This it the iotinator web application, a set of files used by the application served from a local iotinator master module.

NB: the main page for this application is not hosted here, but on each iotinator master module.

This is just a POC. The framework needs to sandbox each module UI to make sure there is no css or id conflict, and no access from one module UI to another.
